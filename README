Many sites need to notify users when certain events have occurred and to allow
configurable options as to how those notifications are to be received.

The project aims to provide a Django app for this sort of functionality. This
includes:

 * submission of notification messages by other apps
 * notification messages on signing in
 * notification messages via email (configurable by user)
 * notification messages via feed
 
 
 This fork includes following improvements:
===========
 
 * HTML emails are sent if you include a full.html file in your folder
 * CSS is precompiled and rendered into the HTML elements (some email clients don't support external css)
